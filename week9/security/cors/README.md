# CORS example

### /etc/hosts 

put the following in your /etc/hosts

```127.0.0.1 wasec.local sub.wasec.local wasec2.local```

Run index.js, this starts two servers, client and a server on ports 7888 (client), 7889 (server)

```node index.js```

On windows, the following link might help for overriding /etc/hosts
* [DNS modification Windows](https://blog.kowalczyk.info/article/10c/local-dns-modifications-on-windows-etchosts-equivalent.html)

You can then visit:

* [a GET request to sub.wasec.local that fails, because CORS is not enabled](http://wasec.local:7888/)
* [a GET request to sub.wasec.local which gos through, because CORS is enabled](http://wasec.local:7888/?cors=on)
